       <ul>
           <li>Crime Shows:</li>
            I love watching murder/crime shows. From the super intense ones like 'Criminal Minds' to the funny ones like 'Bones'.
           <li>Fast & Furious Franchise:</li>
            Another guilty please I have is binge-watching the Fast and Furious saga! Though none of them will have as sweet of a place in my heart as Fast Five.
           <li>Running:</li>
            In 2021 I started running again. As a former runner who lost herself after having kids, jobs, and... well <i>a life</i>. It is my therapy!
           <li>My Best Year Challenge:</li>
            Part of running for me has been joining my favorite challenge. My Best Year! Thanks to this amazing challenge I have put in almost 800 miles in 2021!
           <li>Challenging myself:</li>
            While it's not my favorite thing ever I really do love to grow from challenging situations. Uncomfortable moments lead to growth and I want to grow as a person.
